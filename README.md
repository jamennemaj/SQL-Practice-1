# SQL, Excel Dashboard Practice

Overview:
Recently, I created a sales dashboard for RDC (example client) to track their sales department's performance. The dashboard incorporates a variety of metrics, including total sales, cost, operating profit, sales by retailer, and sales by region. It also utilizes various visualizations, such as line, bar, and pie charts, to communicate the data clearly and concisely. I leveraged SQL JOIN, AVG, and other functions to query and compile the sales data.
