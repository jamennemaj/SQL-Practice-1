# SQL, Excel Dashboard Practice

Overview:
As part of my work for an example client, RDC, I created a sales dashboard to track the performance of their sales department. The dashboard includes a variety of metrics, such as total sales, cost, operating profit, sales by retailer, and sales by region. I used SQL JOIN, AVG, and other functions to compile and query the sales data. Additionally, to communicate the data clearly and concisely, I used various visualizations, such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts.

Objective:
The objective of the dashboard was to provide RDC's sales team with a single platform to view key metrics related to their performance. This made it easy for them to identify strengths and areas of improvement.

Data:
To create the dashboard, I sourced data from Kaggle.com, which initially labeled the data as Adidas sales. However, I renamed it after a popular entertainment group, Real Dream Change the World. The data includes sales records.

Process:
The first step was identifying RDC's key metrics for analysis and dashboard creation. Next, I downloaded the data from Kaggle as an Excel file and normalized it. After that, I created a schema using MySQL Workbench and imported the Excel data into the schema's tables. To address business intelligence questions, I used operands such as SELECT, JOIN, AVG, WHEN, and ORDER BY. Finally, I used Looker (formerly Google Data), a data visualization tool, to create the dashboard. I exported SQL result sets as CSV files and added the data to Looker for my dashboard.

Results:
The sales dashboard has been a valuable tool for RDC's sales team. It has helped them identify areas where they are excelling and areas where they need to improve. For instance, the dashboard revealed that their sales team is performing well in coastal regions but could improve their performance in the Midwest region. Overall, the sales dashboard has been a successful project that has helped our sales team improve their performance and identify new opportunities.
